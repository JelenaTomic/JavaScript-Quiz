## Description
This week's homework challenge was challenging to say the least. There was no starter code given, and we needed to show all the knowledge we have so far. We had to make a quiz with focus on java script.
It has to be a multiple choice option quiz with a time limit and every incorrect answer will deduct extra seconds from your clock.
